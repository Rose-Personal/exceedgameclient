# armorup_times_gauge

**Category**: Stats
**Description**: Gain armor equal to gauge size times specified amount. Scales armor with gauge resources.

## Parameters

- `amount` (required): Multiplier for gauge size
  - **Type**: Integer

## Supported Timings

- `during_strike` - During strike resolution

## Examples

**Gauge-based armor:**
```json
{
  "timing": "during_strike",
  "effect_type": "armorup_times_gauge",
  "amount": 1
}
```

**Double gauge armor:**
```json
{
  "timing": "during_strike",
  "effect_type": "armorup_times_gauge",
  "amount": 2
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Armor = gauge size Ã— amount
- Encourages gauge hoarding for defensive benefits
- Creates scaling defensive options
- Can provide significant armor with large gauge
