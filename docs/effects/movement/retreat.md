**Category**: Movement
**Description**: Move away from the opponent by a specified amount. Character moves backward, increasing distance.

## Parameters

- `amount` (required): Number of spaces to retreat
  - **Type**: Integer
  - **Range**: Any positive integer
- `and` (optional): Chained effect that executes after retreating
  - **Type**: Effect object

## Supported Timings

- `after` - After strike resolution

## Examples

**Basic retreat:**
```json
{
  "timing": "before",
  "effect_type": "retreat",
  "amount": 1
}
```

**Retreat with chained effect:**
```json
{
  "timing": "after",
  "effect_type": "retreat",
  "amount": 2,
  "and": {
    "effect_type": "draw",
    "amount": 1
  }
}
```

**Large retreat:**
```json
{
  "timing": "before",
  "effect_type": "retreat",
  "amount": 3
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Triggers character effects at timing "on_retreat"
- Movement amount can be modified by `strike_stat_boosts.increase_movement_effects_by`
- May not be able to retreat the full amount due to arena boundaries (space 1 minimum)
- Sets `local_conditions.movement_amount` to actual spaces moved
- Character cannot retreat past space 1
