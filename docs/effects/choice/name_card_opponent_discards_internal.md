## Implementation Notes

- This effect is automatically generated and should not be used directly in card definitions
- It serves as the execution phase after card name selection in name_card_opponent_discards
- Searches opponent's hand for cards matching the named card name
- Discards up to the specified amount of matching cards found
- If fewer matching cards exist than amount requested, discards all available copies
- Executes discard_effect only if at least one card was actually discarded
- Reveals opponent's hand if reveal_hand_after is true
- Creates appropriate log messages for successful or failed discard attempts
- Part of the two-phase naming system: selection â†’ execution

## Real Usage Examples

This effect is generated automatically by the game system and does not appear directly in card definitions. It is created when:
- Player completes card name selection in name_card_opponent_discards
- Game needs to execute the actual search and discard operation
- Internal game state transitions require the named card effect to be processed
