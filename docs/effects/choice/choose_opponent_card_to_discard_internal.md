## Implementation Notes

- This effect is automatically generated and should not be used directly in card definitions
- It serves as the execution phase after player selection in choose_opponent_card_to_discard
- Takes the card_ids selected by the player and performs the actual discard operation
- The opposing player's selected cards are moved to their discard pile
- Creates appropriate log messages for the discard action
- Part of the two-phase choice system: selection â†’ execution

- Game needs to execute the actual discard operation
