    ☐ New graphic for spell circle

    Breaking:
        Review mid-strike Tech interactions:
            - Faust remove boost effects needs to be reviewed, stuff like powerup_opponent and other random effects that Faust can remove mid-strike
            - probably any during_strike ability?
            - Relevant for Bang too
    Nice to have:
        ☐ Random selection from server-side to match your queue
        ☐ Clean up choose from topdeck for searching library
        ☐ Add Generic ChooseCardsFromZoneToZone
        ☐ Load replays from the server via match id - display match id to user, load from blob storage via id, simplify id from guid
        ☐ Pachelbel Cannon and other min_amount=0 shouldn't have an OK button and pass button for 0.
        ☐ Draw a highlight on the zone that you need popout selection, or otherwise have a button to bring up the right zone.
        ☐ Some characters default to character action for strike and have a way to turn it off?
        ☐ Hilda Condensity/Happy Chaos Steady Aim - played not faceup is obvious which card it is due to delay while player decides choice
    AI bugs:
        ☐ Shadaloo Intelligence from AI hangs
        ☐ AI Akuma Fakout asks for a 2nd card afterwards and forces wild swing?
 Write tests for:
    Axl:
    Testament:
    Zato:
    Faust:
        ☐ Make 1 look at and 1 action choice and not can_pass choose it automatically
        ☐ Whatcouldthisbe interactions
        ☐ Love removing stuff
            ☐ Sweep
            ☐ Love
            ☐ Snip
            ☐ BoneCrushing - revert range, - remove mid-before effects
            ☐ Dust
            ☐ Thrust - remove mid-before effects
