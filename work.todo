Bug:
    Breaking:
        Treasure:
            ☐ Things in chest don't show up in deck counts on dive charge, so you know stuff is in there.
        ☐ Review mid-strike Tech interactions:
            - Faust remove boost effects needs to be reviewed, stuff like powerup_opponent and other random effects that Faust can remove mid-strike
            - probably any during_strike ability?
            - Relevant for Bang too
    Nice to have:
        ☐ Load replays from the server via match id - display match id to user, load from blob storage via id, simplify id from guid
        ☐ Palchelbel Cannon and other min_amount=0 shouldn't have an OK button and pass button for 0.
        ☐ Highlight zone that you need popout selection
        ☐ Some characters default to character action for strike and have a way to turn it off?
        ☐ Move action buttons around
        ☐ Hilda Condensity/Happy Chaos Steady Aim - played not faceup is obvious which card it is due to delay while player decides choice
        ☐ cpu tech brutality/beheaded cards
        ☐ Shadaloo Intelligence from AI hangs
        ☐ AI Akuma Fakout asks for a 2nd card afterwards and forces wild swing?
 Write tests for:
    Axl:
    Testament:
    Zato:
    Faust:
        ☐ Make 1 look at and 1 action choice and not can_pass choose it automatically
        ☐ Whatcouldthisbe interactions
        ☐ Love removing stuff
            ☐ Sweep
            ☐ Love
            ☐ Snip
            ☐ BoneCrushing - revert range, - remove mid-before effects
            ☐ Dust
            ☐ Thrust - remove mid-before effects

Bugs:

Later:
    ☐ Networking - make server smart, validate moves, and hide card ids from client
