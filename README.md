# Exceed fan game client
This is a Godot project for an implementation of the Exceed Fighting System card game from Level 99 Games.
I do not own any of the art IP in this project and do not have affiliation with any of the creators.

The goal of this project is to have a playable version of the game in a web browser.

This project is paired with a game server written in nodeJS.

# Code Layout
